Requires at least: 3.1
Tested up to: 3.3.1
Stable tag: 0.8.1

A plugin that creates groups for users and allows you to change the content (with use of shortcodes) to change content depending on which user is logged in.

== Description ==

Add users by using the standard User management in wordpress. Just set them to the role of client.

Use shortcode [escl_logged_in]content[/escl_logged_in] to make content available only to logged in users.
With the [escl_logged_in] shortcode, you can specify only for a certain user or certain groups by using the attributes 'user' and 'group'.
i.e. To show content only to user 'joebloggs':
* [escl_logged_in user="joebloggs"]content[/escl_logged_in]

And to show content only to groups 'group1' and 'group2' (When using multiple groups, the groups must be separated by a '|'):
* [escl_logged_in group="group1|group2"]content[/escl_logged_in]

N.B. This is a beta version. The more feedback we get, the quicker we can make it into a stable version.
